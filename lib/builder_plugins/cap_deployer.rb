# This plugin will deploy your app using capistrano.
# If the build fails the app won't de be deployed and if it passes it will try to deploy to a list of stages you can supply.
# It will send an email notifying if it was successful or not and a special artifact with the capistrano output will be created.
#
# Configuration
# In your project's cruise_config.rb file:
#
# Set the email addresses which should be notified about deployment
# project.cap_deployer.emails = ['email@example.com']
#
# Pass an array of stages you want to deploy to
# project.cap_deployer.stages = ['staging','production']
#
# Important: this plugin assumes you are using ssh keys for deployment
#
